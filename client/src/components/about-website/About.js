            This website was built to help small local businesses and individual food startups connect with their local communities - whether that be buyers or even suppliers. <br/><br/>
            While there are websites out there that help sellers to connect with their customers and provide a selling platform for small business, the fees for selling on these platforms can add up and end up taking a large chunk out of your hard earned money. Sprout aims to provide free services and advertising platform where the seller is in full control of their system, goods and payment.
            <br/>
            This way, you wonâ€™t have to worry about Sprout taking any of your profits, you just focus on selling! You will only need to consider the fees from payment processing parties such as Visa, Paypal etc. but again, the payment methods you accept are completely in your control.
            <br/>
            In order for this to work, I designed a ticket order system. This will help you take control of your customers and the way you sell your items - sellers can have full control over which orders to accept and which to decline. Why is this important? There are many reasons why this would be useful for a seller: bad experiences, miscalculations in stock or thoroughly check through each order before confirming. <br/> <br/>
            The main purpose of our unconventional approach is to help you build customer relations based on trust, loyalty and community. <br/>
            I made this website focus heavily on regional location - so each region will have their own unique local sellers. Not only does this build long lasting local connections, but the delivery and collection system becomes much easier and faster for both seller and buyer, meaning food arrives fresh and can last longer! This system also works well for suppliers as rather than just being able to supply markets or restaurants, individuals can also enjoy the benefits of having a supplier in the local area. 
            <br/><br/>
            From my understanding, loyalty and trust is the foundation of any good business - if a business can build this especially when starting out they will have the best chance at succeeding.
            <br/><br/>
            I wish you good fortune and success on your journey. 
            <br/><br/> 
            Thank You
