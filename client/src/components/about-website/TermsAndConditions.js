            </p></li>

            <h1>Terms & Conditions & Privacy Policy <br/> For Sellers </h1>
            <li><p>
            You allow your real name to be displayed to users that are following you. The shop name you come up with must not be offensive or inappropriate.
            <br/><br/>
            This website is designed so that you can design your own product layout. This include adding attributes like price, quantity, allergens, images, description. 
            The content you create must be safe and meet the regulatory standard. The content you create is not monitored and so 
            you must only provide clean and safe content for your memebers. If it's reported offensive by members it will be taken down.
            <br/> <br/>
            You agree to give your real business / home address and not a random address that has no correlation to you, before creating a post. 
            This information will not be sold or used without your permission. 
            This information is important because it verifies that your legitimate and not a bot. 
            This helps buyers and sellers trust one another more and reduce the likelihood of a scam to take place if both seller and buyer knows each other.
            This is for your own benefit and to help you get more followers.  
            <br/> <br/>
            The Business / Home address you provide will only be shown during these circumstances. 
            <br/> <br/>
            <span>First Circumstance.</span> Before creating a post you will have to add an address, you will be given an option to let all user see your address,
            when users click on your post that displays all the information. 
            This is for convenience in the case seller’s want to be suppliers to local businesses or buyer’s to let them know who is the closest. 
            Another use case for turning on allow address for everyone to see is in the case you are planning to let buyers collect orders. 
            <br/> <br/>
            <span>Second Circumstance</span>. When a buyer decides to order your product. This will be converted into a ticket and sent to "seller" (found at top of the page). 
            Seller’s will see the ticket at stage "1/4", at this stage sellers have the choice to approve the ticket or decline the ticket. 
            Seller will have the buyer good and bad score to indicate if the buyer is either good or bad and the contact email to contact the buyer if something looks suspicious. 
            Once Approved, this ticket goes from stage "1/4" to stage "2/4". At this stage the buyer can choose between delivery or collect, 
            if the buyer clicks collect, the seller address will appear for the buyer to see. 
            This will let the buyer know where to collect the order and check if the address is fake or real before sending the payment. 
            <br/><br/>
            <span>Third Circumstance</span>. When the buyer send the payment with the option as COLLECT, ONLY the seller’s address will be saved into the outstanding ticket. 
            I created the system this way in the case a seller decide to send the ticket to the bin and say they have not received the buyer’s payment. 
            Even if the seller goes and change their address their previous address has been saved. This way buyer’s have the seller’s address and their payment receipt and can take legal actions against bad behavior like this. 
            NOTE. The seller can delete this ticket after 30 days as soon as it enters the bin.
            <br/><br/>
            Receiving Payments. I have put in payment options. These currently includes Visa, Paypal and Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Cardano. 
            These payment options are subject to changes, there maybe more or less payment options in the future. As a seller you have the option of adding payment options
            E.g for visa you must enter your bank name, first name, last name, sortcode and account number. 
            ( From my research, this information is safe and can be shown to buyer’s at checkout.
            The most damage people can do by seeing this information is send / deposit money in your account, 
            and withdrawing money is impossible without the 3 digits CVV). When dealing with Cryptocurrencies its up to you to ensure the address 
            and wallet are correlated with each other and the address you put in is correct. Always test before accepting payments via Cryptocurrencies.
            <br/><br/>
            The payment information will only be displayed to buyer’s at stage “1/2” so they can send you payment. 
            So its in your best interest and completely up to you to fill this section with complete certainty, 
            and any payments going missing is down to you and the payment processor E.g visa you will need to talk to your bank and NOT this website. 
            The payment reference and transaction id will be displayed through the entire process so buyer and seller can check. 
            This will also be stored inside history where seller and buyer can check what payment they used to buy certain products with. 
            In the case you try and change your payment information after the buyer has sent the payment so stage “2/4” to “3/4” the previous information you have given will be saved and the buyer will see this. So please do not try this. 
            Only change your payment options when there is nothing in stage “3/4” and “4/4”.
            <br/> <br/>
            Paying your Tax. The Ticket History is not a correct representation of your estimated income or by any means your real income. 
            The purpose of history is to show the sellers and buyers what they have sold and bought and to keep track of their transaction. 
            It is also recommended to record your own sales and expenses. You can use other apps that are designed for this. 
            Again the Ticket History is for the seller’s convenience and to save time so seller don't have to manually write down every order. 
            I have put a 365 days count down on all the tickets that are created. After this time the Seller can delete the ticket from the history.
            So its best to record all sales at the end of the day, week or month. This Website will NOT help you do your taxes.
            <br/> <br/>
            Sellers must provide correct details from above and make sure it’s accurate in a way that does not mislead or scam buyers. 
            These Include giving wrong payment information, wrong address, wrong product information, etc...
            <br/> <br/>
            When delivering please ensure for high valued products you send the parcel that requires a signature from a buyer. 
            This will prevents you from getting scammed and from buyers saying they have not received it.
            </p></li>

            <h1>Terms & Conditions & Privacy Policy <br/>For Buyers </h1>
            <li><p>
            The email you sign up with is used for checkout and logging in. You can change this contact email under edit page “Add Business Address & Contacts”.            
            <br/> <br/>
            As a buyer you must always check or ensure that the product you are buying is from a legitimate seller. 
            I have put in users good and bad score and product rating and reviews to help guide you on what product is safe and trusted by others. 
            So Please be careful when buying from sellers with bad rating / no address / no name / no contact details. 
            Even if sellers have these attributes still be careful.
            <br/> <br/>
            When you checkout at stage “2/4” this is the most important part. This is where you put your payment and pick delivery preferences. 
            It is up to you to get this correct and send the correct details. In the case you do send wrong information. 
            You can contact the Seller. The seller email and phone number should be within the ticket. 
            <br/> <br/>
            There is an “Add Address” section on “buyer” (top of the page) this will allow you to save address and checkout faster. 
            This information will only be used within this section and no where else.
            <br/><br/>
            Be extremely careful when paying with cryptocurrencies these can be a good alternative payment method. 
            Only ever do these payment methods for low valued products, the user has a good score, others have recommend this user as trusted and other reasons. 
            So Please be careful when paying with crypto because anything can happen. In the case something does happen you have the seller’s address. 
            I do not recommend paying with crypto, it's just there if you ever want to use it as an alternative.
            <br/><br/>
            This website does not have any payment processing functionality, so every payment is done manually by you. 
            E.g usually website make users use their card and enter their 16 digits and CVV to pay with visa. However, 
            because this is a website designed for the free market and individuals. You must manually go into your bank and make the payment to the seller. 
            E.g The seller will have different payment options that they accept, this will be indicated in the product section page.
            When you are about to pay at stage “2/4” you will see the seller’s payment options if you click Paypal, 
            you must go to Paypal and send the payment to the seller Paypal address. If Visa, you will be given the seller visa deposit information and 
            you will have to manually go to your online banking and pay, you wont be able to checkout with a card. So Please make sure to type in the correct information.
            I have designed the system so as soon as you go from stage “2/4” to “3/4”, buyer’s and seller’s payment information are saved. 
            This is in the case the seller decide to change the information to mislead you or scam you. 
            This information will only be used within the ticket system section and no where else on the website.
            <br/><br/>
            Your Taxes, The Ticket History is not a correct representation of your expenses or what you have bought. 
            The sellers can delete these tickets after a year. The purpose of this Ticket History is to help you see what you have bought every year and
            the payment method you used. Again this is not accurate and is only used for the sack of helping you find recent orders. 
            Myself and website will not help you do your taxes or have any relation with you and taxes.
            <br/><br/>

            </p></li>
