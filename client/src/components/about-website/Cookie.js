            The use for this JWT is everytime you log in, this cookie will give you a secret code which only you can use to remain logged in and access secret / private routes, which is
            exclusive to logged in users only. This cookie can be deleted by simply logging out and the browser will eat this cookie. If you want another cookie, simply just log in.
